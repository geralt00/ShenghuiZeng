I'm enthusiastic about the intricate aesthetics of Charm and Beauty Quark Physics, working on [LHCb](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) and [BESIII](http://bes3.ihep.ac.cn/) experiment.
The complex entanglement of decay amplitudes makes this field incredibly attractive. Imagine these decays as a cosmic dance, where particles reveal their secrets. This dance can cause an asymmetry between matter and anti-matter, a phenomenon we call Charge-Parity (CP) Violation â€“ a key puzzle piece in understanding why our universe is dominated by matter. Also, the possibility of discovering new particles hidden within multi-body decays adds an exciting layer of mystery to our research.
